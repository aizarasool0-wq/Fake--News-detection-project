# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

### 📘 Overview
This repository contains a series of Data Science and AI assignments focused on *Fake News Detection* using *Machine Learning* and *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*.  
The goal is to explore, preprocess, and model real-world news data to classify whether an article is *real* or *fake*.

---

### 📂 Repository Structure
### 🧠 Project Objectives
- Understand and explore the *Fake vs. True* news dataset.  
- Perform *text preprocessing* (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).  
- Extract features using *TF-IDF* or *Bag of Words*.  
- Train *classification models* (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).  
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 🗂 Dataset Details
*Source:* Kaggle – [Fake and True News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

*Files:*
- Fake.csv → Contains fake news articles.
- True.csv → Contains real news articles.

Each file includes:
- title → Headline of the news article  
- text → Full text content  
- subject → Category of the news  
- date → Publication date
